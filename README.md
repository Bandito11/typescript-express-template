# TypeScript Node Server

 This is a simple typescript node server. Its gonna be the basis for all my projects and it uses npm libraries that I commonly
 use. This will be updated as time goes by. If you want to use it feel free to do so.

# Install Instructions
- Download and follow instructions to install NodeJS from https://nodejs.org
- Download and follow instructions to install Github from https://github.com 
- Go the the folder you would like to download this project for in the terminal and then write `git clone https://github.com/Bandito11/node-template myProject` where **myProject** is the name of the project you want to create.
- Write `cd ~/path/to/myProject` in the Terminal and press enter.
- Write `npm i` and press enter to install all the packages you need to run the node app. This will install all the packages in the package.json.
- Now write `npm run start:dev` to run the node app. Open a browser window and write `localhost:5000` and you should see the message on line 30 in the `src/server.ts`.
