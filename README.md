# FOREVER TODO :)

 This is a simple typescript node server. Its gonna be the basis for all my projects and it uses npm libraries that I commonly
 use. This will be updated as time goes by. If you want to use it feel free to do so.



# Instructions- 
- Write < cd ~/path/to/project > in the Terminal and press enter. 
- In the terminal write < npm i > and press enter. This will install all the packages in the package.json.

All of the ready to distribute files are on the dist folder.
